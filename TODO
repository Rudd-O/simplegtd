* dynamic toolbar
  * show buttons based on which pane is focused
* toolbar actions: add / remove tasks
  * use global shortcut key event handler rather than taskview key event handler
* mark selected task(s) as complete with keyboard (F12 to toggle, figure out if a checkbox is also worth trying)
* support todo.txt / done.txt
* configure where todo.txt / done.txt are saved
* more toolbar actions (activatable via hotkeys) that apply to selection: add remove tags / lists with a popover menu / possibly typeahead find
* context menus to do all the above
* custom filters with filter language (implement task objects)
* custom sorting
* grouping
* fast data entry (possibly with autocomplete tags and lists)
  * this may require moving away from the simple text box we use for entry right now
* automatic creation date addition
